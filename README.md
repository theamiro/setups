Developer Environment setup files

## Overview

This project aims to help developers set up their environments quickly using Homebrew. It includes various Brewfiles for different development setups such as iOS, JavaScript, and PHP.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Homebrew installed on your machine. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone /path/to/your/repo.git
    cd repo
    ```

2. Choose the appropriate Brewfile for your development environment. For example, to set up an iOS development environment:

    ```sh
    brew bundle --file=ios.Brewfile
    ```

3. Similarly, for JavaScript or PHP development environments, use:
    ```sh
    brew bundle --file=js.Brewfile
    brew bundle --file=php.Brewfile
    ```

## Available Brewfiles

-   `ios.Brewfile`: Setup for iOS development.
-   `js.Brewfile`: Setup for JavaScript development.
-   `php.Brewfile`: Setup for PHP development.

Feel free to add more Brewfiles for other development environments as needed.
